While recent approaches\nadvance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate\nhallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative\nsamples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.\nIn this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)\nframework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the\nmodel's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between\nsampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion\nmodel, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This\nfailure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual\npreferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better\ncapture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.\nExperiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP\neffectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal\ncapabilities."}

Recognizing the lack of semantic\nunderstanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based\nretrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image\ncharacteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely\non supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph\npairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based\nsupervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval\nreliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based\nunsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled\ntraining data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and\nruntime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and\nsupervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as\na deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,\nreplacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in\nimage-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability\nof our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph\ngeneration, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in\ncounterfactual image retrieval."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how\nvision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders\n(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as\nan explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the\ndiscovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to\nvision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the\nontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that\nSAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an\nimplicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these\nrepresentations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model\nDINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize\nhierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token\nthrough each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic\nhierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the\npotential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks."}

While recent studies suggest that\nadding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not\nused in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream\nperformance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are\ntruly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a\nsystematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally.\nOnly URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format\ndomain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream\nperformances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at\ninference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining\nenables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a\nclassifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not\naccelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering\nhuman-interpretable control over generation."}
